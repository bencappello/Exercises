* Maybe no number attribute
* Toys form, posts to `/toys`
* Refresh button for collection + individual pokemon
* Even editing/updating a pokemon.

Pacing:

* Phase 0:
    * JBuilder templates
* Phase 1:
    * Pokemon index (index)
    * Pokemon form (create)
    * Pokemon show (show)
* Phase 2:
    * Pokemon update form
        * Change our show page to a form.
        * Prefill the attributes.
* Phase 3:
    * Extend JBuilder Pokemon#show to nest Toys
    * Write PokemonToys Backbone collection
    * List the toys for the pokemon in the view.
    * Click over to show a Toy
    * Add a Toy form to the pokemon.
* Bonus Phases?
    * Content editable? Click to edit?
    * Make toys at the same time as the pokemon?
* Maybe day 3 is rewriting our pokemon stuff with Views and finally
  Router.
